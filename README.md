# :floppy_disk: Installation
Clone the repo via:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hylley/Concord.git
cd Concord
```

If you're gonna change or edit something, I personally recomend setting up a virtual environment before going any further.
(if you do not need, you can skip to the requirements part)

If you do not have the tool installed:
```
pip install virtualenv
```

Then create your own virtual environment:
```
virtualenv [preferred name]
```

An then proceed to activated:
```
[preferred name]\Scripts\activate
```

Now you can install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
